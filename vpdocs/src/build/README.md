# Build

Start by cloning the [f-a-maze-ing repo](https://github.com/aPixelInSpace/F-a-maze-ing) from Github.

Then, to build the project from the source code, you'll need the latest dotnet SDK available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

Finally, navigate to the root folder (where the "f-a-maze-ing.sln" file is) and run the command ``dotnet build``.

Every dependencies will be restored and the project is now compiled.

# Build

To build the project from the source code, you'll need the latest dotnet SDK available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

After you've cloned the project from Github, navigate to the root folder (where the "f-a-maze-ing.sln" file is) and run the command ``dotnet build``.

Every dependencies will be restored and the compiled project will follow.

This application is a fun pet project that I initiated to learn the [F# langage](https://fsharp.org/).

You can find the entire source code on [github](https://github.com/aPixelInSpace/F-a-maze-ing) under the MIT license.

Special thanks to these projects/ressources and the people that created/mantain them wich this app relies on (in no special order) :

[The Bolero web framework with the Elmish architecture](https://fsbolero.io/)

[FSharpPlus (an extension library for F#)](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus)

[The command line parser for .Net](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline)

[The high speed priority queue for C#](https://github.com/BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp)
